Frontend Development:

    Set Up React Project with Vite:
        Install Node.js if you haven't already.
        Create a new React project using Vite by running npm init @vitejs/app my-travel-buddy --template react.
        Navigate into the project directory: cd my-travel-buddy.

    UI Design and Component Structure:
        Sketch out wireframes or design mockups for the user interface.
        Identify the main components needed such as search bar, destination cards, weather widgets, itinerary planner, etc.
        Create a component hierarchy and plan out the state management strategy.

    Install Dependencies:
        Install necessary packages for making API requests, managing state, and UI components.
        For example, you may need axios for making HTTP requests and react-router-dom for client-side routing.

    API Integration:
        Set up functions or hooks to handle API calls to OpenWeatherMap, Mapbox, and REST Countries API.
        Test API calls and handle responses appropriately, considering loading states and error handling.

    User Interactions:
        Implement event handlers for user interactions such as searching for destinations, selecting travel dates, and adding activities to the itinerary.
        Update the UI dynamically based on user inputs and API responses.

    Map Integration:
        Integrate Mapbox API to display interactive maps showing selected destinations and travel routes.
        Customize map styles, markers, and popups to enhance the visual experience.

    Weather Display and Itinerary Planner:
        Use weather data from OpenWeatherMap API to display current conditions and forecasts for selected destinations.
        Implement features for users to create and manage travel itineraries, including adding activities and specifying dates/times.

Backend Development with Symfony:

    Set Up Symfony Project:
        Install Symfony CLI if you haven't already: wget https://get.symfony.com/cli/installer -O - | bash.
        Create a new Symfony project: symfony new my-travel-buddy.

    Define API Endpoints:
        Design RESTful API endpoints to handle requests for destination information, weather forecasts, and travel itineraries.
        Define routes and controller methods for each endpoint.

    Controller Logic:
        Implement controller actions to process incoming requests, interact with external APIs, and return JSON responses.
        Use Symfony's dependency injection to access services and components needed for processing data.

    Service Layer:
        Create service classes to encapsulate business logic and interact with external APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, REST Countries).
        Keep controller actions thin by delegating complex operations to service classes.

    Data Models and ORM:
        Define entity classes to represent data entities such as destinations, weather forecasts, and travel itineraries.
        Configure ORM mappings and relationships between entities using Doctrine.

    Authentication and Authorization:
        Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints if needed.
        Decide on the authentication method (e.g., JWT tokens, session-based) based on your project requirements.

    Error Handling and Testing:
        Implement error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages in case of invalid requests or server errors.
        Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your backend code.
